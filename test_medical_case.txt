Testing RAG Pipeline SQS Notifications

This is a test document to verify our notification system works correctly.

Patient Case Study:
- Patient: Test Patient  
- Age: 35
- Chief Complaint: Testing the RAG pipeline with SQS notifications

Medical History:
The patient presents with symptoms that require documentation processing
through our RAG pipeline system. This test will validate that:

1. Textract can extract text from this PDF document
2. Bedrock can generate embeddings from the extracted text  
3. DynamoDB stores the document chunks and embeddings
4. SQS notifications are sent upon SUCCESS

Assessment:
The pipeline should complete successfully and send notifications to:
- Main notification queue (rag-pipeline-notifications)
- Success-specific queue (rag-pipeline-success)

Treatment Plan:
If this works, we'll see notifications in our monitoring system!
This validates the complete end-to-end notification functionality.

Follow-up:
Monitor SQS queues for success notifications with processing metrics.
