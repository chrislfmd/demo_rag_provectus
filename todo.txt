âœ… COMPLETED: DynamoDB implementation review and fixes (2024)
- Fixed critical data structure mismatch in load function 
- Enhanced error handling and validation in all Lambda functions
- Updated dependencies with proper tiktoken specification
- Created comprehensive testing framework
- Documented complete implementation review and recommendations

âœ… STATUS: DynamoDB implementation is PRODUCTION READY for demo/development

ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS (Prioritized):

1. IMMEDIATE (Ready to deploy):
   - Deploy current DynamoDB implementation
   - Test with real PDF documents end-to-end
   - Monitor CloudWatch logs for any issues

2. SHORT TERM (Enhance functionality):
   - Add retrieval Lambda function for similarity search (application-level)
   - Create simple query API for stored embeddings
   - Add Great Expectations for data quality validation
   - Performance testing with larger documents and concurrent uploads

3. MEDIUM TERM (Production optimization):
   - Implement S3 KMS encryption when pipeline is stable
   - Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   - Create deployment automation scripts
   - Load testing and optimization

4. LONG TERM (Advanced features):
   - Plan Aurora PostgreSQL + pgvector migration for native vector search
   - OR evaluate specialized vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
   - Implement RAG query interface with retrieval functionality
   - Add authentication and authorization

Having s3 KMS encryption issues, got rid of it and enable that later when the whole pipeline is tested
s3 still encrypted static, not on transit


Implement aurora postgres pgvector later - used dynamodb instead for demo.
